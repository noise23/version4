Version Crypto New Official Development Repo
==================================

### What is Version (V)?
[Version](http://www.version2.org/) (abbreviated V), also known as Version and V is a rare [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) design with [proof-of-stake consensus](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Version is based on [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), while containing many important innovations of the cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.

Repo Guidelines
================================

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [Version Talk](http://www.peercointalk.org/) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
* For development ideas and help see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/version).
